:page-title: Jekyll AsciiDoc Quickstart
:page-description: A forkable blog-ready Jekyll site using AsciiDoc

You've successfully set up and deployed an Jekyll website powered by AsciiDoc using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc-quickstart[*Jekyll AsciiDoc Quickstart*] project. If everything is in order then changes to the AsciiDoc content will be automatically published to your `gh_pages` branch and hosted via Jekyll and Github.

== What do I do now?

Now that you've set up your website to run with AsciiDoc, you have a ton of options available to you.
